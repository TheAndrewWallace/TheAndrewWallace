### 🤖 Hi, I'm Andrew!

Hi, I'm Andrew, an AI researcher due to start my PhD in Septemeber 2025. I have previously worked at the University of Cambridge on AI research, I am a Google DeepMind Alumni, and I graduated from LJMU with a first class Bachelors (Hons) in Computer Science. In my personal time, I am a a hobbyist game developer, and I am learning German and Mandarin Chinese. Please reach out if you would like to collaborate, ask questions, or for any other reason.

## 🛠️ My Projects
* **Generative Adversarial Network for generating images of Ganyu from Genshin Impact** - A GAN Ganyu, if you will.
* **Deep-Q Network controlled cars in PyBullet** - Good exeriment into learning to create custom simulation environments for developing and training AI with PyBullet.
* **Graph Neural Network for Drone Trajectory Deconfliction (University of Cambridge)** - Creating a neural network with custom attention module to deconflict agent trajectories whilst generalising to the number of agents.
* **Multi-Agent System Adversarial Simulation and AI (Bachelors Dissertation LJMU)** - Red vs Blue team fighting to eliminate the enemy using a Deep-Q network. Experimented with strategies involving cooperative and adversarial behaviour in relation to reinforcement learning.
