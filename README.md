## 🚀 About Me
* 🧠 Im facinated by AI - mainly Reinforcement Learning & Multi-Agent Systems.
* 👨‍🎓 It's my ambition to eventually get my PhD and contribute to the field of robotics and artificial intelligence.
* 🕹️ I love gaming!

## 🛠️ My Projects
* **Personal Portfolio Website** - Nice way to showcase some of my projects
* **Generative Adversarial Network for generating images of Ganyu from Genshin Impact** - A GAN Ganyu, if you will.
* **Deep-Q Network controlled cars in PyBullet** - Good exeriment into learning to create custom simulation environments for developing and training AI with PyBullet.
* **Graph Neural Network for Drone Trajectory Deconfliction (University of Cambridge)** - Creating a neural network with custom attention module to deconflict agent trajectories whilst generalising to the number of agents.
* **Multi-Agent System Adversarial Simulation and AI (Bachelors Dissertation LJMU)** - Red vs Blue team fighting to eliminate the enemy using a Deep-Q network. Experimented with strategies involving cooperative and adversarial behaviour in relation to reinforcement learning.

## 🎯 Goals for 2025
* 👨‍🎓 Get a Computer Science postgraduate degree offer
* 📖 Start postgraduate study
* 🗣️ Learn more Mandarin Chinese & Reach German Level B2
* 💻 Make more AI projects and share them
* 🎥 Make videos of some of my most exciting projects
* 🎮 Complete 3 game jams (1/3 so far!)
* 🛡️ Get up to date on Final Fantasy XIV
